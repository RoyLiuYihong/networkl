Installing
**********

Before installing NetworkL, you need to have
`setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ installed.

Quick install
=============

Get NetworkL from the Python Package Index at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkl

or install it with

::

   pip install networkl

and an attempt will be made to find and install an appropriate version
that matches your operating system and Python version.

You can install the development version (at github.com) with

::

  pip install git://github.com/networkl/networkl.git#egg=networkl

More download file options are at http://networkl.github.io/

Installing from source
======================

You can install from source by downloading a source archive file
(tar.gz or zip) or by checking out the source files from the
Mercurial source code repository.

NetworkL is a pure Python package; you don't need a compiler to build
or install it.

Source archive file
-------------------

  1. Download the source (tar.gz or zip file) from
     https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkl/
     or get the latest development version from
     https://github.com/networkl/networkl/

  2. Unpack and change directory to the source directory
     (it should have the files README.txt and setup.py).

  3. Run :samp:`python setup.py install` to build and install


GitHub
------

  1. Clone the networkl repostitory

       git clone https://github.com/networkl/networkl.git

  2. Change directory to `networkl`

  3. Run `python setup.py install` to build and install


If you don't have permission to install software on your
system, you can install into another directory using
the `--user`, `--prefix`, or `--home` flags to setup.py.

For example

::

    python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python

or

::

    python setup.py install --home=~

or

::

    python setup.py install --user

If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory
you will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location.
See http://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#search-path for further details.


Requirements
============

Python
------

To use NetworkL you need Python 2.7, 3.2 or later.
The easiest way to get Python and most optional packages is to install
the Enthought Python distribution "`Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_".
There are several other distributions that contain the key packages you need for scientific computing.

NetworkX
------
NetworkL requires NetworkX to be installed on your machine.
You can get NetworkX from https://github.com/networkl/networkl
